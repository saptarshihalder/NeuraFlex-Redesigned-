    NeuraFlex is a tiny language model implementation designed to run on standard laptops.
    Despite its small size, it demonstrates the core principles behind large language models
    like GPT, but at a fraction of the cost and computational requirements.
    The transformer architecture allows the model to capture patterns in text
    and generate new content based on what it has learned. With enough training data and compute,
    these models can become quite sophisticated. NeuraFlex is focused on being
    accessible and educational, allowing users to understand how language models work
    without requiring specialized hardware or massive datasets.

    like GPT, but at a fraction of the cost and computational requirements.
    The transformer architecture allows the model to capture patterns in text
    and generate new content based on what it has learned. With enough training data and compute,
    these models can become quite sophisticated. NeuraFlex is focused on being
    accessible and educational, allowing users to understand how language models work
    without requiring specialized hardware or massive datasets.
